# Relay — AI Interview Coach

A personal, authenticated interview-practice POC for software-engineering candidates.

## What works now

- CV PDF upload or professional-summary paste → generated, editable professional profile
- Source-backed engineering evidence extraction with a meaningful-profile gate before grounded conversational interviews
- Supabase Postgres persistence with Google sign-in and user-scoped access
- Responsive Home, Profile, Practice, Progress, Interview, and Results screens
- Conversational interview sessions with a persisted five-question blueprint, saved messages, evidence-backed prompts, feedback, and follow-ups
- Hands-on React + TypeScript interview with persisted code checkpoints, interviewer prompts, and technical feedback
- Gradual competency updates after completed conversational and hands-on sessions
- Progress insights that separate no-evidence, first-session baseline, and multi-session trend states with recurring coaching themes
- Browser voice recording → Gemini transcription → editable interview answer
- Deterministic demo coach when no API key is configured
- Gemini API provider when `GEMINI_API_KEY` is configured

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>.

Current product boundary: the grounded conversational interview flow is implemented for software-engineering profiles only. Relay does not yet do live web research, market-intelligence caching, executable code evaluation, or a cloud IDE.

To use live Gemini responses, create `.env.local`:

```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
# Optional; defaults to gemini-3.6-flash
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-3.6-flash
```

Create the key in Google AI Studio. Gemini's free tier is rate-limited and Google states that free-tier content may be used to improve its products, so do not use it with sensitive career data. Keep `.env.local` private. Supabase stores profile, interview, and source-document data with user-scoped access policies.

## Supabase + Google setup

The hosted POC uses Supabase Postgres, Auth, and private Storage. For a local or Vercel deployment:

1. Create a free Supabase project. Install and authenticate the Supabase CLI, link the repository to the project, and run `supabase db push`. If the CLI is unavailable, paste and run every file in `supabase/migrations/` in filename order in the Supabase SQL Editor. Existing projects must also run `202608290002_complete_adaptive_interview_loop.sql` and `202608290003_richer_feedback.sql` after pulling this update.
2. Copy the Supabase project URL and publishable key from Project Settings → API into `.env.local`:

   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=sb_publishable_your_key
   ```

3. In Google Cloud Console, create an OAuth client with application type **Web application**. Add `http://localhost:3000` and your Vercel production origin (for example, `https://your-app.vercel.app`) to **Authorized JavaScript origins**. In **Authorized redirect URIs**, add the Supabase Google provider callback URL shown in the Supabase Auth provider setup.
4. In Supabase, open **Auth → Providers → Google**, enable Google, and add the Google OAuth client ID and client secret.
5. In Supabase, open **Auth → URL Configuration**, set the **Site URL** to the deployment origin, and add these redirect URLs:

   ```text
   http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
   https://<vercel-domain>/auth/callback
   ```

6. In Vercel, add `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, and optional `GEMINI_MODEL` as project environment variables, then deploy from the connected repository.

Keep uploaded CV PDFs under 4 MB. Vercel Functions accept request payloads up to 4.5 MB, and the smaller application limit leaves room for multipart form overhead. Gemini errors shown by the app include a safe status and provider message; a `401`/`403` points to the API key or its restrictions, `404` points to `GEMINI_MODEL`, and `429` indicates rate limiting.

Supabase's free projects pause after one week of inactivity and do not include automatic backups. Resume inactive projects when needed and export/backup important data separately.

## Verify

```bash
npm run lint
npx next build --webpack
```

The Webpack verification build is used because Turbopack's CSS worker cannot bind a required local port in this environment.

## Next slices

- Live web research and a cached market-intelligence layer for current software-engineering interview expectations
- Executable candidate-code evaluation with preview, tests, console, and cloud-IDE-style workspace feedback
