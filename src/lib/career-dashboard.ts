 * Career Brain row (Release 2 does not auto-reconcile coach observations).
 *
 * Resolves each non-dismissed observation's evidence and each story's
 * evidence count in parallel, after `loadPracticeInputs` resolves (each of
 * those needs its rows first). `now` is never read from the clock here -- it
 * is threaded straight through to `recommendPractice`, matching that
 * selector's own determinism contract.
 *
 * Throws {@link CareerDashboardError} with code `PROFILE_REQUIRED` when the
 * caller has no profile yet; every other empty Career Brain table (no
 * opportunities, observations, stories, plans, or sessions) is a valid
 * dashboard, not an error.
