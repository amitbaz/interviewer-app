/**
 * End-to-end coverage for the full adaptive-interviewer pipeline (spec §16):
 * blueprint generation (Task 8) -> round-based session creation (Task 10) ->
 * the opening turn (Task 7) -> repeated response turns (Task 7 + Task 10),
 * entirely in-process. This is the sibling to `release2-flow.test.ts`, but
 * drives `createSessionWithBlueprint` (the ROUND-based creator) instead of
 * `createSessionWithPracticeBlueprint` (the PLANNED-PRACTICE creator that
 * file exercises), so it is written from scratch rather than copied.
 *
 * Unlike `release2-flow.test.ts` (which mocks `@/lib/repositories/interviews`
 * entirely and hand-rolls a persistence stand-in), this file mocks NOTHING
 * at the repository-function level. `createSessionWithBlueprint`,
 * `revealFirstQuestion`, `recordConversationTurn`, and the `getSession`
 * reload path it all funnels through run for REAL, unmocked, against a fake
 * Supabase CLIENT (`rpc`/`from`) backed by in-memory tables. The fake RPCs
 * (`create_conversation_session_with_blueprint`, `record_conversation_turn`)
 * reproduce the exact field semantics of the live Postgres functions in
 * `supabase/migrations/202609010001_adaptive_interviewer.sql` and
 * `supabase/migrations/202609020001_coverage_target_required.sql` -- see the
 * fake RPC implementations below for a running commentary tying each branch
 * back to its SQL counterpart.
 *
 * Gemini is stubbed via a queue this file fills in call order: one
 * "interviewer line" response per `openingTurn`/`speakIntent` call, and one
 * "answer evaluation" (assessor) response immediately before each `nextTurn`
 * call's matching "interviewer line" response, mirroring the two-call shape
 * `nextTurn` makes every turn (assessor, then the interviewer line).
 * `GEMINI_API_KEY` is deliberately EMPTY during blueprint generation (so
 * `generateInterviewBlueprint` takes its deterministic fallback path with
 * zero network calls, the same technique `release2-flow.test.ts` uses) and
 * only set once the turn loop starts, where a controllable `read` per
 * scripted answer and a distinct line per call are actually needed.
